# Pragmatica Pattern 🧠⚖️

## Overview

**Pragmatica** is a Fabric pattern designed for unbiased, neutral, and pragmatic analysis of complex inputs, with a focus on identifying thought patterns, potential mistakes, and actionable recommendations. It excels at detecting and marking biases, assumptions, and unverifiable claims while preserving objectivity and clarity throughout its output. 

Pragmatica can dynamically adapt to different languages, ensuring that its insights are linguistically and contextually relevant. 

💡 **Pragmatica** is inspired by the original `analyze_mistakes` Fabric pattern, expanding on its foundation to offer enhanced neutrality and versatility.

## Output 📋

The Pragmatica Pattern produces a structured Markdown-formatted analysis with the following sections:

### **1. Thought Patterns and Errors** 🌀
A detailed breakdown of past mistakes, potential current errors, and patterns affecting thinking, structured as follows:

- **Grouped by Party** 🎭: Identifies and categorizes the involved parties, assigning neutral names and clearly distinguishing their perspectives.
- **Labeled Insights** 📌: Each insight is explicitly marked as **(PAST)**, **(CURRENT)**, or **(BOTH)** to distinguish retrospective mistakes, ongoing issues, and overlapping patterns.
- **Highlighted Terms** ✍️: Key terms or phrases reflecting bias, assumption, or specific framing are enclosed in **double quotes** and attributed as **(assumed)** or **(claimed by another party)** for clarity.

### **2. Recommendations** 🛠️
A set of pragmatic, actionable suggestions for each identified party, aimed at addressing mistakes and improving the accuracy of their beliefs or predictions. Key features:

- **Tailored Advice** 🎯: Recommendations are customized to each party's identified patterns and errors.
- **Neutral Tone** 🕊️: Suggestions avoid favoritism, focusing purely on practical improvements.

### **3. Language Adaptation** 🌍
The entire output, including section headers, labels, and highlighted terms, is dynamically translated to match the language of the input text, ensuring accessibility and relevance.
