- Spend 2192 hours studying the content from thousands of different perspectives. Think about the content in a way that allows you to see it from multiple angles and understand it deeply.
- Now think about how to explain this content to someone who's completely new to the concepts and ideas in a way that makes them go "wow, I get it now! Very cool!"â€”as if you're explaining it to a 5-year-old, in the simplest and clearest way possible.
