**ðŸš€ High-Quality Patterns for Fabric**

This project aims provide a collection of **high-quality curated and well tested patterns** for [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric). Another reason for creating this repository is:
- The fact that I don't like the naming concention of patterns in the main Fabric repository, so some of the patterns here are a slightly modified and renamed copy.
- I don't need the hole set of patterns offered in Fabric, so this is a handy way to download only those I need.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
It is possible to manually copy the needed patterns or clone this repository, but the esiest way to get the patterns is to:
- run `fabric -S`
- chose option `11`
- paste this repository URL `https://github.com/wmahfoudh/fabric-patterns`
- hit `enter` twice

### 2. Explore the Patterns
Each pattern resides in its own directory generally with documentation on usage and implementation.
