**ðŸš€ High-Quality Patterns for Fabric**

This project aims provide a collection of **high-quality curated and well tested patterns** for [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric). Another reason for creating this repository is the fact that I don't like the naming convention of patterns in the main Fabric repository, I prefer short names which is justified by the limited number of patterns I use. I find creating aliases a bit cumbersome.

Few patterns here are simple renamed Fabric copies. Most are improved versions and many are completely written from scratch.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
It is possible to manually copy the needed patterns or clone this repository, but the esiest way to get the patterns is to:
- run `fabric -S`
- chose option `11`
- paste this repository URL `https://github.com/wmahfoudh/fabric-patterns`
- hit `enter` twice

### 2. Explore the Patterns
Each pattern resides in its own directory generally with a `README.md` file.
